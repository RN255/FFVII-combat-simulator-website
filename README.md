## Project Name: FFVII-combat-simulator-website
A web game based on Final Fantasy VII. It was one of my favourite games growing up so it seemed like a nice idea to try and re-create it. I have already done this using python and pygame, but I think I would do it again with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The player plays as Cloud and you must fight against the computer who is Sephiroth. The game is quite simple, but it helped me learning web design.

## Motivation
I had already made this using python so thought it would be a suitable challenge to make it again with JavaScript.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- fully mobile responsive
- embedded audio
- interactive interface
- turn based combat
- health and magic bars adjust as value decreases or increases

## Lessons learnt
- how to make a game with JavaScript

## future development
- add more characters so player can choose
- create more rounds with different enemies
- some kind of animation might make it more interesting
